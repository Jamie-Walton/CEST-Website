## Starting the Development Website

To start the development website, you will need to have `django` and `npm` installed. Then, follow these steps to launch the website on your localhost:

(1) Enter `python3 manage.py runserver` in the terminal to start the backend server.

(2) Navigate to the frontend with `cd frontend`.

(3) Start the frontend app with `npm start`.

If the formatting looks odd, run `npm build`, then restart `npm` again.
